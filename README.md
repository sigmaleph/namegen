Source for pre-existing first names is https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-data-by-state-and-district-of-

Source for pre-existing last names is https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2010_surnames.html

Source for generated names is a neural network created list of names generated by looking at the pre-existing names above.

Optional arguments:

  -n NUMBER, --number NUMBER
                        number of names to output
  -f, --fake            output generated names rather than existing ones
  
  
  -p {-1,0,1}, --popularity {-1,0,1}
                        1 is popularity weighting, -1 is inverse weighting, 0 is no weighting
                        
                        
  -g {m,f,n}, --gender {m,f,n}
                        m returns masculine names, f returns feminine names, n returns gender-neutral names
                        
                        
  -t {fake,real,first,last,full}, --type {fake,real,first,last,full}
                        fake returns fake names (equivalent to -f), real or first returns real first names, last returns real last names, full returns first name/last name pairs
                        
  --agemin AGEMIN       will return names older than this age
  
  --agemax AGEMAX       will return names younger than this age
